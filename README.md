## Application Discription
I followed the tutorial and made an TODO-LIST application using react native platform. 
This is the home page of the app and the user can simply fill the text field to add to-do things. When it's done, just click the text and it turns to grey. Users are able to remove things by clicking the 'remove' button.

## React Native
React Native is a Facebook-supported framework designed to build device-agnostic mobile applications. React Native framework uses React.js library in order to create a true native mobile app. The important difference between
React Native and other framework is that the former uses native components instead of web components to create the user interface, along with JSX — a syntax that is used to embed XML with JavaScript.React Native is based on JavaScript and allows users to share the code between various platforms, including Android, iOS and web apps.
Swift, being the iOS-native language designed by Apple to power apps has obviously no issues with integrating into the iOS design and leveraging all the UX principles. On the other hand, building the app with Swift is, in fact, coding a native app from scratch. Thus, every element needs to be polished separately.
React Native, on the other hand, uses JavaScript as a power behind the scene and leverages the internal APIs to run native elements. Considering that, the user interface is indistinguishable with the native one, yet easier to code. What’s more, due to web development-legacy of JavaScipt, the apps have no issues with being displayed on various screen sizes – and that may be a point when building an app for iPhone and iPad at the same time.
