## Application Discription
I followed the tutorial and made an TODO-LIST application using react native platform. 
This is the home page of the app and the user can simply fill the text field to add to-do things. When it's done, just click the text and it turns to grey. Users are able to remove things by clicking the 'remove' button.

## React Native
React Native framework uses React.js library in order to create a true native mobile app. The important difference between
React Native and other framework is that the former uses native components instead of web components to create the user interface, along with JSX â€” a syntax that is used to embed XML with JavaScript.
